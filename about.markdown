Hello there. I spend my days writing code (sometimes shitty, sometimes not) and diving into random books that catch my interest. I’m into the whole end-to-end AI thing—training models, deploying them and ensuring they work out in the wild.

Lately, I’ve been exploring the intersection of tech, creativity, and whatever piques my curiosity. I like experimenting with new ideas and seeing what comes out, whether it’s a quirky project or something surprisingly useful.
